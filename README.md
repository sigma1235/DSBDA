Group B: Assignments based on Data Analytics using Python
Assignment 1: Facebook Metrics Data And Adult Data Analysis
In this assignment, we work with the Facebook metrics dataset and perform the following operations:

Create data subsets: We create subsets of the dataset based on specific criteria or filters.

Merge Data: We merge multiple datasets together based on common columns or keys.

Sort Data: We sort the data based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

Transposing Data: We transpose the data to interchange rows and columns.

Shape and Reshape Data: We reshape the data to convert it into a different structure or format.

Visualize the data: We use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot graphs and visualize the data.

Assignment 2: Air Quality and Heart Diseases Data Analysis
In this assignment, we work with the Air Quality and Heart Diseases datasets and perform the following operations:

Data Cleaning: We clean the datasets by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.

Data Integration: We integrate multiple datasets into a single dataset based on common attributes or keys.

Data Transformation: We transform the data by applying mathematical or statistical operations, feature scaling, or encoding categorical variables.

Error Correcting: We correct errors in the data, such as fixing inconsistent values or resolving data quality issues.

Data Model Building: We build predictive models or analyze patterns in the data using machine learning algorithms or statistical techniques.

Visualize the data: We use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot graphs and visualize the data.
